            <p>Where Moonies all over the universe unite! A place to find vast amounts of information about the Sailor Moon 
                universe and world. What?? You don't know what Sailor Moon is?? Sailor Moon is a japanese animation by Naoko Takeuchi. 
                Sailor Moon was first produced in manga magazine Nakayoshi from 1991 to 1997. In 1992, the manga was adapted into an anime in Japan 
                and came to the United States in 1994. 
            </p>
            <p>Sailor Moon's story is about magical girl fighting evil and protecting the world and universe. Our main character,
                you guessed it, Sailor Moon doesn't quite realize she is a pretty soldier in the begining. It take the interference of a talking
                cat, Luna to help guide her in the direction of fighting evil my moonlight. But Sailor Moon was NOT the first Sailor Scout. You'll
                just have to watch the show to figure out who came before Sailor Moon. While you watch it, don't be surprised to find yourself
                in love (and a little exhuasted from the tranformation sequences). The show is your classic good vs bad. It has some over the 
                top romance and amazing friendships. That's my favorite part! The friendships! 
            </p>
            <p>Still confused? Okay think of.. Powerpuff Girls and My Little Pony and Winx Club and She-Ra. Get the point? Colorful
                girls who beat up bad guys and have the best of friends. When Sailor Moon grew in popularity, it along with some other 
            anime, it made anime coming to the United States easier. It created a path for more amazing shows we've come to love (or sometimes hate). 
            To this day, you will find references of Sailor Moon in varius media. You can check that out in the References tab. 
            The point is, once you know the gimicks and what not, you're gonna start seeing it everywhere. You are going to see
            just how much Sailor Moon impacted animations today.  </p>
