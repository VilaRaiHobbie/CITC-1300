            <p>All cosplay is valid and okay! It really just depends on what you want to do! Often times I just want to portray 
                a character without the stress of making a character. So we look at our common cosplay retailers. Sometimes I want 
                something that is "more" than basic retail work and that is when we commission another artist to create the cosplay. 
                And sometimes we are up for the challenge, inspired by our colleagues. No matter what it is or the reason, they are 
                all valid and fun! Let no one tell you otherwise!
