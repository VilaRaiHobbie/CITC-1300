            <p>All cosplay is valid and okay! It really just depends on what you want to do! Often times I just want to portray 
                a character without the stress of making a character. So we look at our common cosplay retailers. Sometimes I want 
                something that is "more" than basic retail work and that is when we commission another artist to create the cosplay. 
                And sometimes we are up for the challenge, inspired by our colleagues. No matter what it is or the reason, they are 
                all valid and fun! Let no one tell you otherwise!

            <h2>Buy It</h2>
            <p>
                Buying cosplays is okay and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. We recommend that if you are buying your cosplay,
                to set yourself a budget. Make sure to do plenty of research on where you want to purchase your cosplay from and try
                finding reviews by other cosplayers to see the quality for what you are buying. Always remember, you can alter store
                bought cosplays. Depending on your skill level and equipment, you can make accessories or take in parts of a store bought 
                cosplay so that it suits you the way you would like it. Just remember, store bought cosplays are not allowed in 'Craftsmanship'
                cosplay contests. Conventions might have a 'runway' or a section to the contest to allow for store bought cosplays. Make sure
                to ask the Cosplay Coordinator regarding those rules or check the convention's website. 
            </p>
            <h2>Make It</h2>
            <p>
                Making a cosplay can be taxing. Make sure to give yourself plenti of time. Though it is common for cosplayers to finish their
                cosplays a few hours before the convention. Again, while this is common, it's not ideal. Not for you time or sanity. We would 
                suggest that you give yourself a deadline date. Make sure to research your pattern and watchout for sales and deals
                for fabric, sewing notions, foam and whatever other supplies you may need. Don't be afraid to reach out to other cosplayers on 
                social media to ask for tips and tricks. In our experience, cosplayers are extremely friendly and have no issues giving you tips 
                to help you reach your cosplay goals.
