            <h3>Who Are We</h3>
            <p>Vila and Sean met while volunteering for a local convention in their area. They were working as celebrity
                handlers when they met and enjoyed hanging out with each other and talking about games and cosplay. Eventually 
                for fun, they cosplayed Officer Jenny and Nurse Joy from Pokemon. Shortly after, Jesse and James from Pokemon
                as well. Then they decided to tackle a dream cosplay for both of them. Making Angemon and Angewomon from Digimon. 
                The cosplays took nearly a year where they worked on most weekends to try to complete their goal. As they did, 
                they considered other duo characters and occassionally drag their friends into a cosplay group. Their goal is to 
                hopefully turn Just Do The Thing Cosplay into more than just a duo and instead into a group of likeminded cosplayers
                who act as a safe place at any convention they are attending.

            <h2>Conventions We Frequent</h2>
            <p>We try to attend any of our local cons at least for a day! However we still have our key favorites below. If there
                are any cons you think we should go to, reach out to us and let us know! We would love to attend more Conventions 
                but it does take planing and resourcing. Another way you might be able to help us go to a convention is by contacting 
                that convention and recommend us as a cosplay guest. The more requests that come this way, the higher chance the convention
                will reach out to us and see about our being able to attend! 
            </p>
