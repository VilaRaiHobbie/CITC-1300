<h2>Who??</h2>
<img src="images/Fairly_Odd_Parents_1.jpg" alt="Fairly Odd Parents">
<p>Who is Just Do The Thing Cosplay? After Vila and Sean met each other while volunteering for a convention, the two decided
    to become friends who gamed together and cosplayed together. Starting with something silly and simply like Officer Jenny
    and Nurse Joy. But then they decided to do something bigger. A dream cosplay for both of them. Angemon and Angewomon. 
    With many hours into this build, the two talked about the plethora of future cosplays to do together. Now we go rope other 
    friends into our adventures and cosplay fun! 
</p>
<p>Just Do The Thing Cosplay believes ALL cosplay is valid cosplay. Whether you buy it, make it, or thrift it. Whether it is a mix
    of two fandoms, or a bunny suit version. All cosplay is cosplay and the most important part is that YOU are enjoying it. 
    Just Do The Thing Cosplay promotes healthy con life. Make sure to shower and get plenty of water and food. If you find as at a 
    convention, please know, we are a safe place. We will hang out with you and play games and take photos.
