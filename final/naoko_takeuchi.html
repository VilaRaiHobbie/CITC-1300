                        We would discuss methods of working on cosplays that would be considered uncoventional and possible weird. 
                        Crafting is an amazing artform and you can use just about anything to get the visual you want! Flooring foam to make
                        angel wings, googly eyes to make rivets. Hotglue in molds to make simple molds when resin isn't an option and more.

                        This panel would be about sewing. Tips and tricks on how to sew just what you need. Going over things like, 
                        various feet and what they would be used for. The various needles and how to use them and tell them apart. Fabrics and how
                        to determine what sort of fabric to use for what cosplay as well as thread. We would also go over learning how to read a pattern.

                        <p>
                        In this panel we would cover wig styling at its basics. Wigs, where to get them and what to look for. Tools
                        used in common wig styling such as crimpers, wide tooth combs, hair pins, flat iron and hair spray. We would 
                        touch on topics regardin teasing and shaping and how to complete some common anime looks like high ponytails and spikes.

                        <p>We would discuss what to consider when you decide you want to join a cosplay contest. We would cover mostly 
                        craftsmanship aspects, starting with creating a build book for you cosplay and to take plenty of pictures of the 
                        progress. We would talk about what judges are looking for and what contestants should and shouldn't say about their 
                        work. The last thing we would touch on is stage preformance and what can break a tie between you and another cosplayer.

                        Werewolf and everything in between. We bring the games and would decide what game would be best during the time frame. Or 
                        let those who come decide and we could have multiple Learn To Play tables happening during the panel.
