                        so maybe that's not all there is to Tuxedo Mask. He actually does come when the scouts need help. However he tends to fall into evil hands 
                        more often than not and ends up with a few other alias. Aside from being an occasional distraction during a fight, he was also the prince of Earth 
                        and it's protector. He and Sailor Moon had a 'Romeo and Juliet' sort of romance before their rebirth.

            an evil entity that saved her. But her body remained weak and partially mechanical which is only seen once in the orignal anime. While sometimes she is Hotaru, sometimes the evil entity who took
            claim to her body is the one present. Pharoe 90, Mistress 9 and Sailor Saturn are her other identities. Pharoe 90 and Mistress 9 however were evil, eating the pure hearts of anyone she could to 
            gain strength. Eventually, Sailor Saturn appear to destroy a world that can no longer be saved. But Sailor Moon manages to stop this from occuring and what actually happens is Sailor Saturn is killed
            and reborn. Sailor Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus choose to take care of her and raise her. She grows fast though, taking the mantle of Sailor Saturn once again.
